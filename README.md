APPLICATION OVERVIEW

bf-ide is a fully functional integrated developement environment (IDE) for BF written in Java.

THE LANGUAGE

BF (also know as brainfuck) is an esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller.
It is one of the simplest turing complete languages consisting of only eight instructions:

    + - > < . , [ ]

INSTRUCTIONS

Each BF program begins by initializing an array of (typically) 30,000 characters and a pointer
variable that initially points to the zeroth element of that array.  The instructions behave as follows:

    +    Increment the value at the current pointer by one.
    -    Decrement the value at the current pointer by one.
    >    Increment the pointer so it points to the next element in the array.
    <    Decrement the pointer so it points to the previous element in the array.
    .    Print the character at the pointer to the console.
    ,    Read in the next character from standard input to the current pointer.
    [    While the value at the pointer is not zero.
    ]    Jump to the matching opening bracket.

SAMPLE PROGRAMS

This program will print the character '0' (ascii value 48):
++++++[>++++++++<-]>.

This program will print 'Hello World!':
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
